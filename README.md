# StudentCrudApp
The Student Detail CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) App with Singleton Design Pattern using a Layered Approach in Java is a software application that enables users to perform basic CRUD operations on student records. The application follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the database connection exists throughout its lifecycle. It adopts a layered approach to maintain a clear separation of concerns, making the code more modular and maintainable.

Description of the App:

Singleton Design Pattern: The Singleton pattern ensures that the database connection object is instantiated only once, and all subsequent requests for the connection refer to the same instance. This optimization improves performance and resource management.

Layered Approach: The application architecture follows a layered approach, typically including the following layers:

Presentation Layer: This layer handles the user interface and user interactions. It allows users to add, view, update, or delete student details through a user-friendly interface.
Business Logic Layer: The business logic layer contains the application's logic and rules. It processes user inputs, communicates with the data access layer, and validates data before passing it on.
Data Access Layer: The data access layer manages the interaction with the database. It handles CRUD operations, querying the database, and updating student records.
CRUD Operations: The app enables users to perform the following CRUD operations on student records:

Create: Users can add new student details to the database, including their name, age, address, etc.
Read: Users can view a list of all existing student records or search for specific students based on criteria such as name, age, or ID.
Update: Users can modify the details of existing student records, such as updating their address or age.
Delete: Users can delete student records from the database.
User Experience: The app offers a user-friendly interface, guiding users through the process of managing student details effortlessly. Error handling and validation mechanisms ensure data integrity and prevent unintended actions.

Overall, this Student Detail CRUD App with Singleton Design Pattern and Layered Approach in Java is an efficient and organized solution for managing student records, providing a smooth user experience while adhering to industry-standard software design principles
